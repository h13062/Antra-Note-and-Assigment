Question 8:
use Northwind
SELECT TOP 5 p.ProductName, AVG(od.UnitPrice) AS AvgPrice,
	(SELECT TOP 1 c.City FROM Customers c
	LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
	LEFT JOIN [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
	WHERE od.ProductID = p.ProductID

	) AS MostOrder
FROM Products p
LEFT JOIN [Order Details] od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductName,p.ProductID
ORDER BY SUM(od.Quantity) DESC;


Question 9:
	a)
	SELECT e.City
	FROM Employees e 
	WHERE NOT EXISTS 
	(	SELECT *

	), CityOrder AS(
	  SELECT ShipCity
	  FROM Orders
	)
	SELECT EmpCity.City
	FROM EmpCity
	LEFT JOIN CityOrder CO ON EmpCity.City = CO.ShipCity
	WHERE CO.ShipCity IS NULL
Question 10:
use Northwind
	SELECT (SELECT TOP (1) e.City FROM Employees e JOIN Orders o ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
			GROUP BY e.City ORDER BY COUNT (o.OrderID) ) AS EmployeeCity, 
			(SELECT TOP (1) o.ShipCity FROM Orders o  JOIN [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
			GROUP BY o.ShipCity ORDER BY COUNT(od.Quantity)) AS TotalQuantity

Question 11:
		We can use the key word DISTINCT when query
		As fro creating a new table, we can make a copy of the original table then drop the 
		original then Alter table to modify the the origian table
		For example:
		CREATE TABLE New AS SELECT DISTINCT *FROM Old
		DROP TABLE Old;
		ALTER TABLE New RENAME TO Old;
