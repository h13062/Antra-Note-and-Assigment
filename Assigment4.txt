Question 1
CREATE VIEW view_product_order_[Bui] AS
SELECT 
    p.ProductID, 
    p.ProductName, 
    SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalOrderedQuantity
FROM 
    Products p 
    JOIN OrderDetails od ON p.ProductID = od.ProductID
GROUP BY 
    p.ProductID, 
    p.ProductName;
Question 2:
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_product_order_quantity_[Bui]
    @ProductID int,
    @TotalOrderQuantity int OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT @TotalOrderQuantity = SUM(Quantity)
    FROM OrderDetails
    WHERE ProductID = @ProductID
END
Question 3:
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_product_order_city_[Bui]
    @ProductName nvarchar(50)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT TOP 5
        o.ShipCity,
        SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalOrderedQuantity
    FROM
        Orders o
        JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
        JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
    WHERE
        p.ProductName = @ProductName
    GROUP BY
        o.ShipCity
    ORDER BY
        TotalOrderedQuantity DESC
END
Question 4:
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_product_order_city_[Bui]
    @ProductName nvarchar(50)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT TOP 5
        o.ShipCity,
        SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalOrderedQuantity
    FROM
        Orders o
        JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
        JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID

        p.ProductName = @ProductName
    GROUP BY
        o.ShipCity
    ORDER BY
        TotalOrderedQuantity DESC
END

Question 5:
CREATE TABLE people_[Bui](
    id int PRIMARY KEY,
    Name nvarchar(50) NOT NULL,
    City int NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE city_[Bui](
    Id int PRIMARY KEY,
    City nvarchar(50) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO city_[Bui] (Id, City)
VALUES 
    (1, 'Seattle'),
    (2, 'Green Bay');

INSERT INTO people_[Bui] (id, Name, City)
VALUES 
    (1, 'Aaron Rodgers', 2),
    (2, 'Russell Wilson', 1),
    (3, 'Jody Nelson', 2);

Drop case:
BEGIN TRY
    UPDATE people_[Bui]
    SET City = (SELECT Id FROM city_[Bui] WHERE City = 'Madison')
    WHERE City = (SELECT Id FROM city_[Bui] WHERE City = 'Seattle');
    
    DELETE FROM city_[Bui] WHERE City = 'Seattle';
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    PRINT 'Error occurred, no changes made to DB';
END CATCH;
Question 6:
We can use UNION to between two tables becausse if they are similar they will have same results
SELECT * FROM table1
UNION
SELECT * FROM table2;
