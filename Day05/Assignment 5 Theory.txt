	+There are 5 scenarios:
		if double a/0 with a > 0.0 then infinity possitive 
		if double a/0 with a < 0.0 the negative infinity
		if double a/-0.0 with a > 0.0 then negative NaN
		if double a/0.0 with a < 0.0 then infinity possitive 
		if 0.0/0 -> NaN
5. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its
range?
	+ A wrap around will occur which lead to 2147483647 +1 = -2147483647
6. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?

	+The term ++y indicates this is a postfix  which mean y value assign to x after increase
7. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop
