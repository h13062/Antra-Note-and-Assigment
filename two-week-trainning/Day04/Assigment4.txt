Question 5:
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_birthday_employees_Bui
AS
BEGIN
	CREATE TABLE birthday_employees_Bui (
		id int PRIMARY KEY,

    FROM Employees
    WHERE MONTH(BirthDate) = 2;

END;
exec sp_birthday_employees_Bui
DROP TABLE birthday_employees_Bui;


Question 6:
We can use UNION to between two tables becausse if they are similar they will have same results
SELECT * FROM table1
UNION
SELECT * FROM table2;
